## My Contributions

### Introduction to React.js and Next.js
Entering into the realm of frontend development, I embarked on my journey with React.js and Next.js. Despite being new to these technologies, I embraced the challenge with enthusiasm, eager to contribute to a meaningful project aimed at aiding individuals in quitting smoking.

### Crafting the Frontend
I used React.js, CSS, and HTML to fashion a captivating and user-friendly interface. With a focus on simplicity and engagement, I  designed each page to facilitate seamless navigation while providing an immersive user experience.

## About the Project

### Purpose and Scope
Our project, crafted for a non-profit organization dedicated to smoking cessation, aimed to serve as a comprehensive guide for individuals seeking to quit. We envisioned a platform teeming with resources, from informative content to practical tools, all geared towards empowering users on their journey towards a smoke-free life.

### Key Features
At the heart of our endeavor lay a dynamic tracker, powered by Versel PostgreSQL database, enabling users to monitor their cigarette consumption over time. Complementing this feature were informative sections, including an elucidation on the importance of tracking and a personalized health assessment segment, providing tailored health risk insights.

## How We Built It

### Leveraging Next.js
Harnessing the versatility of Next.js, we seamlessly integrated frontend and backend functionalities, leveraging its page routing capabilities to streamline development. Despite being novices in the hackathon arena, our team rose to the occasion, embracing the iterative process of ideation, design, and implementation.

### Learning and Growth
As newcomers to the hackathon scene, we embarked on a journey of discovery, learning invaluable lessons in teamwork, project planning, and rapid execution. Within the tight timeframe of 7 hours, we navigated the challenges of integration and collaboration, emerging with newfound insights and a profound sense of accomplishment.
